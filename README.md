## Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a robust web application that enables users to manage their profiles securely and efficiently. By leveraging AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Amplify, Cognito, and React, we aim to develop a solution that ensures data security, scalability, and ease of use.

Key Functionalities:
- **User Profile Management:** Users can create, update, view, and delete their profiles, enabling them to personalize their experience within the application.
- **Secure User Authentication:** Implementation of AWS Cognito ensures that user authentication is handled securely, protecting user data and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information.


## Technologies Used

- **AWS Lambda:** Utilized for serverless compute to execute backend logic.
- **DynamoDB:** NoSQL database service used for storing user profiles and other application data.
- **Amplify:** AWS Amplify simplifies the integration and deployment of backend services such as Lambda functions and DynamoDB tables.
- **Cognito:** AWS Cognito provides secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **React:** Frontend framework used for building user interfaces, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience.
