Job Assignment: Full-stack Developer (AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Amplify & Cognito)
Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a Node.js application utilizing AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, AWS Amplify, and AWS Cognito. This assignment aims to evaluate proficiency in creating a secure, scalable application using these AWS services.

Task Overview
AWS Lambda Function:

Create a Node.js Lambda function for handling basic CRUD operations.
DynamoDB Integration:

Design a DynamoDB table for a specified use case (e.g., user profiles, product inventory).
Implement CRUD operations in the Lambda function with interactions to the DynamoDB table.
AWS Amplify Setup:

Utilize AWS Amplify to configure and deploy the backend services (Lambda, DynamoDB).
AWS Cognito Integration:

Implement AWS Cognito for user authentication.
Ensure that only authenticated users can perform CRUD operations.
API Gateway Integration (Optional):

Configure AWS API Gateway to create RESTful endpoints for the Lambda function.
Expected Deliverables
Source Code:

A GitHub repository containing all source code.
Detailed deployment and operation instructions.
Documentation:

README file explaining:
Application purpose and functionalities.
Setup, deployment, and testing procedures.
Design decisions and assumptions.
Demonstration:

Video demonstration or live demo showing the application in action, focusing on user authentication and CRUD operations.
Assessment Criteria
Code quality, organization, and readability.
Effective integration and use of AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, AWS Amplify, and AWS Cognito.
Knowledge of Node.js, especially in handling asynchronous operations.
Ability to secure CRUD operations through user authentication using AWS Cognito.
Completeness of the task as per the requirements and quality of documentation.
(Optional) Integration and configuration of AWS API Gateway for RESTful services.
Additional Notes
Emphasize security best practices, particularly in handling user data and authentication processes.
Demonstrate a clear understanding of managing AWS resources through AWS Amplify.
Showcase error handling and logging capabilities within the application.
